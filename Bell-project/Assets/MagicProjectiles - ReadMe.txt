Magic Projectiles v1.5
------------------------

In this asset, two main folders are included: "InteractiveDemo" and "MagicProjectiles".

The "InteractiveDemo" folder contains a set of prefabs and a script system to easily test out the effects.
Simply open one of the Scene files to try them out.

The "MagicProjectiles" folder contains the particle systems, textures and materials for all the effects.
To use them in your project, you will have to import this folder to your project folder.

The "KunaiEditor" folder may also need to be imported to your project depending on the effects you are using.

F.A.Q.:
------------------------

Q: I think this pack is missing something / This pack doesn't have an effect like this
A: If you have any suggestions for additional content, feel free to send me an e-mail, and it might just be featured in the next version.

Q: My projectile effect isn't working properly!
A: Some of the projectile effects only emit particles when they are moving, so you will have to put it in motion to get the full effect.

Q: My impact effects rotation is odd! 
A: The impact effects default rotation is set to impact at a floor. This means you will have to script the impact effect to be rotated according to the surface direction.

Q: Can you help me with coding?
A: I am unfortunately not a very skilled programmer, but you can get help at Unity Answers: http://answers.unity3d.com/
