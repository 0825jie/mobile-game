Burnblade UI (v.1)
22 February 2015

Designed to fit any game genre, Burnblade contains all the elements you 
may need for your games. The user interface is made in hight resolution, allowing mobile 
developers to use it without quality loss. Every element is sliced and 
sorted in properly named folders for quick usage. In case you dont like how it's 
sliced, full version of the psd files are included with user friendly grouped layers.

The package also contains bonus 3D assets like coins, potions and crystal that 
look exactly like the ones in the interface.

The product features:

- More than 150 Elements & Icons
- Sliced images
- 8 models
- PSD files

* Please note that there is just .psd file and sliced .png files for all of the 
elements in the package. You have to code it on your own, this is just a design, does
not include example scene or atlas.

* The interface is separated into 10 .psd files for easy usage and better workflow.

* If you need any extra elements, that are not included please 
contact me at evilsystem@duloclan.com, and i will add them to the package.
